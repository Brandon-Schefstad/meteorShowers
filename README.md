# Meteor Shower API

This is a passion project where I created a REST API endpoint to deliver information about different meteor showers in 2022. There is a landing page with a schema displayed, an API endpoint with different routes, and a /dev route for database management.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, NodeJS, EJS

This site stores its information in a MongoDB collection and uses both Node and Express to retrieve and update the data. The dev page is rendered in EJS while the landing page is static HTML/CSS/JS.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
